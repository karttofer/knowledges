## CUTS

# L

An "L cut" is an editing technique used in film and audiovisual production to seamlessly combine two different scenes. This technique is called an "L cut" because the timeline of the video and audio tracks resembles the shape of the letter "L."

In an "L cut," the audio from one scene continues to play while the image transitions to a different scene. This creates a smooth transition effect and allows the viewer to hear the audio from the previous scene while beginning to see a new scene. This technique can be used to establish emotional connections between scenes, highlight specific aspects of the story, or simply improve the pacing of the narrative.
