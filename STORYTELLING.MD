## CUTS

## L

An "L cut" is an editing technique used in film and audiovisual production to seamlessly combine two different scenes. This technique is called an "L cut" because the timeline of the video and audio tracks resembles the shape of the letter "L."

In an "L cut," the audio from one scene continues to play while the image transitions to a different scene. This creates a smooth transition effect and allows the viewer to hear the audio from the previous scene while beginning to see a new scene. This technique can be used to establish emotional connections between scenes, highlight specific aspects of the story, or simply improve the pacing of the narrative.

In other hands.

A "J cut" is another editing technique used in film and video production. It involves the audio from a subsequent scene starting before the accompanying video appears, creating an effect where the audio "jumps" ahead of the visuals. In other words, the sound from the upcoming scene is heard before the viewer actually sees the action related to that sound.

This can give us more natural conversations, where the main character might be observing something while another character could make a comment to them regarding what the main character is observing, even while the latter doesn't appear on the scene.

An example would be in Pulp Fiction, where we have the scene in which the two main characters are talking, but there's no J cut or L cut, making the conversation itself feel colder and more robotic.

This isn't bad; it's just a different way of telling the story, as the use of this technique depends on each production.
